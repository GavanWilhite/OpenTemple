# OpenTemple

OpenTemple is a set of project files for quickly constructing a set laser-cut temples. Useful for events like community rituals, festivals, or weddings.

Designs are flexible to facilitate multiple uses. Original use and interpretations are included as a starting point.

### Original Intention

People were invited to write things that they wanted to let go of on the temple. Regrets, fears, negative mindsets, etc.

On the last day of the event, the temple was burned.

### Tools
  - 8' x 4' laser cutter

### Materials
  - 4x panels of 8' x 4' 1/2" plywood
  
### Notes
  - Holes at the top can be used to hang an object in the center. This is a good placement for a wireless speaker.

### Notes
  - Can be built with or without slates. To match the slate pattern shown, offset each slate by 3 cm from the midline, with a nail every 10 cm vertically
  - Attach two fabric strips together with adhesive, drape over the top and adhere to each side after adjusting for desired draping
