### Original Intention

People were invited to write what they wanted to let go of on the temple. Regrets, fears, negative mindsets, etc.

On the last day of the event, the temple was burned.

### Tools
  - 8' x 4' laser cutter

### Materials
  - 4x panels of 8' x 4' 1/2" plywood
  
### Notes
  - Holes at the top can be used to hang an object or speaker aloft in the middle.
  - Burning is easily facilitated by loading wood in from the top of the center chimney

  - Can be built with or without slates. To match the slate pattern shown, offset each slate by 3 cm from the midline, with a nail every 10 cm vertically
  - Attach two fabric strips together with adhesive, drape over the top and adhere to each side after adjusting for desired draping
